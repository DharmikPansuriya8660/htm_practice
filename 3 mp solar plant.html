	  <mark> Estimated project cost = <del>₹ 3000 cr</del> ₹ 4500 cr </mark>
    <h3 style="color:tomato;"> <ins> Aid for developing the project will come from: </ins><h3>
       <p> International Finance Corporation</p>
	   <p> World Bank</p>
       <p> Power Grid</p>
	   <p>•The primary feasibility study of the project has been completed in collaboration with the World Bank</p>
	   <p>•Tender for the study of environmental and social impact of the project area is also being issued</p>
  	   <p>•Madhya Pradesh Power Management Company will purchase 400 MW power from the project</p>
	   
	<h2 style="background-color:lightgrey; color:maroon;text-align:center"> Working of the project</h2>
       <p>•The work of transmission line route survey (to be conducted by Power Grid) will begin from the project area to Khandwa sub station , by the end of January,</p>
       <p>•The project will have floating solar panels of 600 MW power generation capacity in the backwaters of Omkareshwar dam .</p>
       <p>•It is estimated that in 2 years, the project will start providing cheap and good quality power</p>
       <p>•Electricity will be produced in about 2000 hectare water area by installing solar panels in the dam.</p>
       <p>•Solar panels will float on the surface of the water in the reservoir.</p> 
	 <img src="images/Floating Solar Energy Project.jpg">
	   <p>•When the water level of the dam is low, the solar panels will automatically adjust upwards and downwards .</p> 
       <p>•Strong waves and floods will have no effect on them.</p>
       <p>•The sun's rays will continue to produce electricity</p>
	<h2 style="background-color:lightgrey; color:maroon; text-align:center;"> Largest Solar Parks</h2>
       <p> 1. Bhadla , Rajasthan 2245 MW</p>
	   <p> 2. Golmud , China 2200MW</p>
	   <p> 3. Shakti Sthala , Karnataka 2050 MW</p>
	<h2 style="background-color:lightgrey; color:maroon; text-align:center"> Kashi Mahakal Express</h2>
	   <p> The train will run from Varanasi to Indore and connect three major Jyotirlingas</p>
