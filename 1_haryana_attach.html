	 <h3> 
	   <p> Haryana prides itself on being counted among the most economically developed states in India, and why not. </p>
       <p> Ever since Independence, this prosperous state has achieved excellence in various fields, from industry and agriculture to sports.</p>
       <p> It gets its name from two words, har (which means god) and ayaana (which means home).</p>
	   <p> In other words, it is the residence of the gods. On its sacred soil, the great sage Veda Vyasa composed the great epic, Mahabharata.</p>
       <p> It shares its borders with Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.</p>	 
	   <p> Archaeologists and history lovers will find much to do here, as it is home to sites which once hosted the worldâ€™s oldest and largest civilisations.</p>
	   <p> The rich history of Haryana can also be seen in its cultural and historical monuments.</p>
	   <p> The Jal Mahal is situated in the district of Narnual, and was built by the mughal Emperor Akbar in 1590-1591 AD.</p>
       <p> It is a wonderful combination of Hindu and Islamic architectural styles.</p>
       <p> Another impressive structure in Narnaul is Rai Bal Mukund Das ka Chatta. It is also known as Birbal Ka Chatta and is noted for its impressive architecture.</p>
