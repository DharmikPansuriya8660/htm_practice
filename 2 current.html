		<h3  style="background-color:grey;font-family:verdana;color:white;"> What is Avian Influenza? </h3> 	
		 <p> Avian Influenza (Bird flu) is a highly infectious and severe respiratory disease in birds caused by the H5N1 influenza virus.</p>
		 <p> It can occasionally infect humans as well.</p>
		 <p> Although cooking the bird meat (like chicken) kills the virus, it is able to infect human beings while handling the bird, or washing the raw meat.</p>
         <p> India was declared free from avian influenza in July 2015 after completion of disinfection and post operation surveillance.</p>
         <p> As part of preparedness, countrywide surveillance is being maintained against the disease.</p>
         <p> The H5N8 strain outbreaks were reported in 2010, in Asia, and was first found in domestic ducks in China.</p>

		<h3 style="background-color:grey;font-family:verdana;color:white;"> Risk to humans? </h3> 
		 <p> Although it is lethal for birds, the H5N8 strain of avian influenza has a less chances of spreading to humans, as compared to H5N1.</p>
         <p> With continued incidence of avian influenza due to existing and new influenza A(H5) viruses in poultry, there is a need to remain vigilant in the animal and public health sectors, according to WHO.</p>
         <p>‘One health’ approach – zoonotic diseases can be controlled through a coordinated approach from veterinary and health departments.</p>
         <p> Kerala has announced, that culling of ducks in the infected regions will be undertaken as per Central government guidelines (Avian Influenza Action Plan-2015).</p>
         <p> A flock of 1,000 ducks within the 1-km radius of the infection hotspot will be culled to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>
