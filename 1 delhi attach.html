	  <p> Delhi is love, Delhi is haste, Delhi is serene, Delhi is chaos - It is the yang to its own yin. </p>
	  <p> Delhi is a complete deal! From the bustling lanes of Chandni Chowk to the serene and tranquil abode of Bangla Sahib, Delhi makes a complete circle of life.</p>
	  <p> One of the most popular tourist destinations in India, the city has been thriving because of the abundant diversity. </p>
	  <p> Right from stepping out of New Delhi Railway Station, the romance with the city begins.</p>
	  <p> Known for its rich heritage and spiritual history, Delhi attracts a large number of religious tours. Sites like Jama Masjid, Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah, Akshardham, Gurudwara Bangla Sahib and Cathedral Church have become a major religious tourist destination in Delhi.</p> 
	  <p> The best thing about these religious places are that they are open to people of all faith.</p>
	  <p> Heart of India, Delhi is called the city of heartful people and it indeed justifies it with its hospitality</p>
	  <p> The first experience of the city might be chaotic and unorganized but there lies a beauty within this unorganized chaos.</p>
	  <p> The Mughal garden of Rashtrapati Bhawan and various municipal parks in Delhi are a testament of the efforts of Delhi to maintain the ecological balance.</p>
	  <p> These green patches within the city are perfect for having a quiet rejuvenation session.</p>
